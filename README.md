# EDAP1

All scripts can simply be run to produce each plot. 
The script creates a folder called Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project1 on the current working directory,
where the data will be downloaded and unzipped and where the plots will be saved.

To run the scripts on R:
source("plot1.R")

source("plot2.R")

source("plot3.R")

source("plot4.R")
